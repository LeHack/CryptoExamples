# CryptoExamples
Some very simple example code on how to use OpenSSL directly (without EVP abstraction).

The examples include:
* file encryption and decryption using:
    * Camellia ECB with PKCS#7 padding
    * Camellia CBC with PKCS#7 padding


* key pair generation, file encryption and decryption using:
    * RSA with PKCS#1 padding


* key pair generation, file singing and verification using:
    * DSA with SHA-224 digest
